# Swap First and Last Elements of an Array Using Pointers

## Overview
This program swaps the **first** and **last** elements of an integer array using **pointers** in C. It demonstrates how to manipulate array elements directly through pointer arithmetic.

## Features
- Takes user input for the array size and elements.
- Uses pointers to swap the first and last elements.
- Displays the array before and after swapping.

## Input Format
- The first line contains an **integer** `n`, representing the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains `n` **space-separated integers**, representing the elements of the array.

## Output Format
- Prints:
  ```
  Array before swap: 
  ```
  followed by the array elements before the swap.
- Prints:
  ```
  Array after swap: 
  ```
  followed by the array elements after the swap.

## Example Test Cases
### Input 1:
```
4
5 1 9 2
```
### Output 1:
```
Array before swap: 5 1 9 2
Array after swap: 2 1 9 5
```

### Input 2:
```
5
12 45 68 95 67
```
### Output 2:
```
Array before swap: 12 45 68 95 67
Array after swap: 67 45 68 95 12
```
